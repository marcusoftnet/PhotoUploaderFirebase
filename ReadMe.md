# Firebase uploader using Expo

I wanted my React native application to upload pictures to Firebase. I had quite a hard time figuring out how this work using Expo, but this great [YT video helped me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxZO7151HYc&list=WL&index=9)

However, it thought it needed some refactoring and did it here.

I hope you find it useful and build something great.
